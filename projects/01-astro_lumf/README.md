# Determine the parameters of the low redshift galaxy luminosity function

In this project you will reproduce the work by Blanton et al. (2003) who determined the first time the absolute magnitude distribution of galaxies on a significantly large spectroscopically observed sample, the Early Data Release (EDR) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). You will obtain the necessary data from the SDSS SkyServer, a relational database system, which is available after free registration.

## Sloan Digital Sky Survey

The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (sometimes also called the Cosmic Genome Project) is a systematic photographic and specroscopic mapping of the extragalactic universe. During the first phase of the project, an imaging survey was conducted to photograph the sky in five optical wavelength band with a 120 megapixel camera. It was followed by a spectroscopic survey where more than 2 million objects, including more than a million galaxies were observed with a multi-fiber spectrograph.

The SDSS catalog (numerical parameters of the detected objects extracted from the multi-band images) is available as a relational database via SkyServer.
