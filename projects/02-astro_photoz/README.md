# Photometric redshift estimation

## Sloan Digital Sky Survey

The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (sometimes also called the Cosmic Genome Project) is a systematic photographic and specroscopic mapping of the extragalactic universe. During the first phase of the project, an imaging survey was conducted to photograph the sky in five optical wavelength band with a 120 megapixel camera. It was followed by a spectroscopic survey where more than 2 million objects, including more than a million galaxies were observed with a multi-fiber spectrograph.

The SDSS catalog (numerical parameters of the detected objects extracted from the multi-band images) is available as a relational database via SkyServer.
