    "# Community finding alogrithms on a language network\n",
    "\n",
    "If we consider our own social connections, it is evident that there is clustering in it to a very high extent. We went to school with a certain circle of friends, who are likely to know each other, we work at a company, where people also know each other, but these two groups do not necessarily overlap. Many other real-word networks exhibit a high degree of clustering. But finding these communities is not a trivial task, and there are many approaches in the literature for community-finding algorithms (for details see the excellent review paper of Santo Fortunato `[1]`).\n",

    "While representing social connections or power grids as networks might come naturally, other fields also benefit from the somewhat less intuitive network representation of their data. Such a counterintuitive representation is the network of words in linguistics. Because networks are useful when encoding interactions, the network of co-occurring words can be though of as a network of close concepts. In these language networks, community finding corresponds to finding related concepts, or groups of words, which can be attributed to a certain topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a recent paper `[2]`, the authors argue that a network-based approach to finding topics in texts is superior to previous probabilistic methods. Because it is a very demanding task only to understand the methods and concepts of the paper, your main task will be to understand the two approaches discussed in the article, find libraries that implement them, and collect some Twitter data on which you can test the results. Topic modeling on Twitter can be a very tedious task due to the shortness and nature of the tweets, so if you are able to retrieve partly meaningful results, don't be discouraged.\n",

    "## 1. Data acquisition and preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the API of Twitter to download English-language messages related to a certain event or discussion. The easiest way is to select popular hashtag that attracts many users to talk about (such as the official hastags for a Foorball World Championship, political campaing, `#metoo` etc.). You have to create a Twitter profile (if you already did not have one), and an application with credentials for for the authorization of the downloading. It is helpful to use a library such as `tweepy` or `twython` in Python that have built-in routines for the download. However, you may use whatever tool you'd like.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data will consist of many messages that are structured as a JSON file. Have a look at the downloaded data. Try to find methods to include only sensible messages, e.g. exclude retweets from you dataset. Then have a look at the text of the tweets, which is what you'll need for this task. It contains not only words, but also mentions of usernames beginning with a `@` sign, and hashtags marked by `#`, and URLs for example. Break the sentences into words, clean the text from emojis, punctuation etc., then use regular expressions and tokenizers to remove the special parts. The creation of words is called *tokenization* in the natural language processing literature, and there are very good tokenizers specialized for tweets, search for one of them! Try to stem the words to make 'class' and 'classes' fall into one category. You can use the Snowball-stemmer of the `nltk` library, for example. *For examples and tips, you can refer to the NLP lecture notes from the Data exploration and visualization class of the Spring term.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Creating the language network\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have mapped your tweet JSON's to sensible word sequences, create the network of words by linking those words that co-occured in the tweet. Create a weighted network, where link weights correspond to the number of times words co-occured in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Topic modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Explore the proposed methods from the article on you dataset! Try to implement other community finding methods, explore the parameters of the algorithm. Do you get meaningful results? If yes, what parameter setting lead to it! Present and discuss the topics you got. If not, what could be the problem? Can you different community finding algorithms on you dataset?\n",
